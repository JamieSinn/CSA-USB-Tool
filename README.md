# CSA-USB-Tool 

Tool to download all files in a given FIRST season needed to support teams.

This tool downloads all the installers/packages for a given FRC season. CSA's commonly need these on hand in a USB to help
teams update to the latest version or to diagnose issues.

There is a C# GUI available as a github release (recommended), or you can use the `pyusbtool.py` python script.
